1. Make background blue 

2. Make empty table for map, 
however many cells you make, when displayed on the screen should be wider
and farther than the screen

3. Try to make sure the cells are square 

4. Make item types, grass, dirt

5. Make player, able to walk, and jump 

6. Camera follows player 

7. Split the map table into two tables, 

One that is much larger but organized into chunks, each chunk being slightly
bigger than the displayed screen 

and the other being the currently displayed chunk, which changes accordingly
as the player moves
